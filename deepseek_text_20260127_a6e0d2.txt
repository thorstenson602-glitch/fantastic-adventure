[Same Court Caption as Complaint]

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
(Re: Fraudulent Conveyance)

Plaintiff moves this Court to take judicial notice, pursuant to Arizona Rule of Evidence 201, of the following adjudicative facts relevant to the fraudulent conveyance of the Property (APN 207-33-012):

1. The recorded "city-abatement lien" (Inst. No. [ ]) was based on a municipal ordinance that is void for lack of an enacting clause and substantive language.
2. The Notice of Intent to Foreclose on said void lien failed to satisfy the statutory requirements of A.R.S. § 42-18202.
3. Under Arizona law, a foreclosure action based on defective notice is void. (Citing Advanced Property Tax Liens, Inc. v. Sherman).
4. The subsequent conveyance (Inst. No. [ ]) was therefore made without lawful authority and without receiving reasonably equivalent value.

These facts are not subject to reasonable dispute as they can be accurately determined from the recorded instruments themselves. Judicial notice is requested to establish the prima facie fraudulent nature of the transfer under A.R.S. §§ 44-1004 and 44-1005.

Respectfully submitted,
